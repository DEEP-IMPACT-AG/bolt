;; For a REST API, it is useful to support both HTTP Basic
;; Auth (for machines) but to honor cookies passed from a
;; browser in an AJAX call, when the user has logged in via a login
;; form.

;; Here are some utility functions that take a protection system and
;; return a function which takes a Ring request and returns whether that
;; request is authenticated. This is useful to implement the authorized?
;; or allowed? decision points in Liberator.
