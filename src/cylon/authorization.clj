;; Now we can define authorization for Ring handlers (and other
;; functions). In Cylon, it is handlers that are restricted, rather than
;; routes. Handlers are 'closer' to the data, since they serve it, and
;; it is better to consider authorization at the level of the data,
;; rather than define authorizations in the routing logic. The design
;; goal is for Cylon to be completely agnostic to the means by which
;; handlers are accessed, whether via a particular routing library
;; (Compojure, bidi, etc.) or via some other mechanism.

;; An Authorizer is responsible for protected sensitive resources in
;; addition to determining the access credentials of a potential
;; accessor.
