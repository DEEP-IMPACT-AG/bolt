;; Storage API - deprecated

;; The storage API is a temporary abstraction over a k/v database
;; awaiting a graph-based abstraction that can be used with a graphQL
;; query. The fact is that a number of bolt features (users, passwords,
;; tokens, codes, etc.) need durable storage. The graph abstraction will
;; probably be datomic or datascript backed, but perhaps with a tree/edn
;; alternative.
